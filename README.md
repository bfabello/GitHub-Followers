# GitHub Followers

## About
Project I developed from a course by iOS Engineer and Content Creator, Sean Allen.   [iOS Dev Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project](https://seanallen.teachable.com). 

This course covered a wide variety of fundamental topics for iOS development such as:

- Delegates & Protocols
- Persistence Manager for UserDefaults
- Network manager with URLSession and Codable
- Modal Presentation & Passing Data
- Search Functionality
- Custom Views
- Swift 5 Result Type and Error Handling

## App Premise
This is an app where the user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers. From there they have the option to search within these followers for a specific follower, tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower, and save favorite usernames so they donâ€™t have to type them every time

## Features

- No 3rd party libraries
